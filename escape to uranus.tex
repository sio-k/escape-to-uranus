%% chapter 2 idea
%% in medias res, on the way to Mars, with Alex reminiscing a bit about how she
%% got here, and how she made sure that the ship would all have people wanting
%% to go to the same place on it. Their destination is Mars, where they'll need
%% to lay over and refuel to make the trip to the Jovian system.
%% imply that some real heist movie shit went down to get everything to this
%% point. I can't write that for shit, so it's going to have to stay implied.

%% chapter 3: arrival at Mars. Confrontation with security forces, forging of
%% required documents, required signatures etc. to keep things quiet so they can
%% refuel and make their way to the Jovian system in time.

%% set up a bit more of the Dorsa Brevia document, and write a preamble
%% including it's history?

%% so maybe I could carry this on with the main character making their way
%% to Uranus, either Miranda or Titania.

%% On Miranda, there's a city built into a large fault that's the cultural
%% and industrial center of
%% the moon, built along the walls of the fault, with a bunch of bridges linking
%% both sides. Sorta like Buda and Pest, but with way more distance, some
%% cultural differences (dunno if Buda and Pest have those), and significant
%% differences looks wise (one side was founded by people who really don't want
%% government telling them what to do, the other side was founded by people who
%% do want a government; as such, one side is fairly regular, things are
%% guaranteed, there's a police force etc., but it's only a sort of
%% parliamentary democracy, i.e. kind of a demsoc thing; whereas on the other
%% side of the fault they have their own weird forms of consensus-based
%% democracy that vary as much as the visual style of the city between the
%% various boroughs).
%% Miranda also has very low gravity, and as such has a few unique architectural
%% styles that are very filigraine and distinctly Mirandan.
%% Miranda is home to more than enough automated farming equipment and
%% installations to feed the entire Uranian system, if necessary - as it once
%% did. At time of arrival of our protagonist, Miranda no longer performs this
%% function, but just serves as a sort of cultural center of the Mirandan
%% system.
%% Miranda is home to the primary shipyards of the Uranian system, and produces
%% warships (primarily demsoc side), automated mining/refining/manufacturing
%% ships (again, primarily the demsoc side), as well as shuttles, passenger
%% and goods transportation ships (both sides), as well as trans-neptunian
%% and extrasolar colonization fleets (anarchist side).
%% It is also home to what is by far the most advanced research laboratories
%% outwards of the Jovian system, again on the anarchist side (as most
%% scientists have chosen to settle here, for various reasons).
%% There is a significant amount of Discordians on Miranda that not even
%% semi-seriously adhere to the religion, and are making preparations for moving
%% out to 136199 Eris. This is, in fact, the primary reason why so many
%% exploration and colonization ships are built on Miranda - the people are
%% already there, they know they'll need time, they're frequently bored, and
%% they're happy to help others. Also, they're *extremely* good at their jobs.
%% There's a significant contingent of geologists very much intent on studying
%% Triton, who are the primary people to have talked the Discordians into
%% building ships for them, and also the ones known to get on with the
%% Discordians best - and who share in their predilections for massive parties
%% with lots of drinking.

%% On Titania, there's a lot of manufacturing, and a few smaller, more
%% rural-feeling settlements of a few hundred people each. Manufacturing's
%% largely automated, and a lot of it services Miranda, but the inhabitants of
%% Titania don't mind that too much. They do their thing, and have a nice,
%% quiet, comfortable life filled with difficult, but fulfilling work.

%% Oberon is home to all fully automatable manufacturing, and has a
%% correspondingly low population. Certain chemical processes in use on Oberon
%% may make human habitation on the planetoid difficult, if no intervention is
%% made. This is planned, but has been pushed back repeatedly
%% in order to finish the Neptunian and trans-neptunian exploration and
%% automated colonization fleets.
